# Going, Going, Gone

This is one famous kata of the architectural katas published in the "Fundamentals of Software Architecture" book.

I decided to use this Kata to build its architecture artifacts using several code-like tools like PlantUML

In this, I will build an initial architecture template for the rest of Katas that I will try to build in the coming days.
