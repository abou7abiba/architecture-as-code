# architecture-as-code
 
This repository is a trial to practice creating architecture artifacts using code-like files.

Recently, there is a new trend for creating diagrams as code. examples for that is PlantUML which is using a code-like syntax to describe a UML diagram and from it, it uses an engine to generate this diagram.

In this repository, I will try to check if it is possible to depend on such tools to create architecture artifacts? and I will try to analyse the pros and cons for such approach.
